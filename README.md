Code editors are useful, and they can be made even better with text filters and scripts. Here are some of mine.

### HTML Entities & Special Characters

| Includes: | 2 PHP scripts |
| Requirements: | PHP 4 or later |
| Purpose: | convert HTML entity codes to special characters, or special characters to HTML entity codes |
| Function: | Takes selected text or active document and converts accordingly. |
| Usage Suggestion: Connect it to a keyboard command on your code editor. | 
| Notes: | This includes all HTML entities I could find in the [dev charref](http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref) on W3.org. I considered combining both scripts into one, where the filter could ask the user which they wanted, but splitting it is more efficient in my workflow. Setting up a keyboard-capable 2-in-1 version might be a future project, though. |
